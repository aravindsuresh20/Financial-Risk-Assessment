### Financial Risk Assessment and Loan Repayment Prediction using Flask and RandomForestClassifier

This is a web application designed to predict whether a borrower is likely to repay a loan, based on their financial parameters.
The application is built with Flask for the web interface and utilizes a RandomForestClassifier for the prediction model. 
It also includes an automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) component that runs upon application startup.

### Features

* **Loan Repayment Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan (Yes/No)
* based on Income, Loan Amount, and Debt-to-Income Ratio.
* **Automated EDA**: Performs an exploratory data analysis on the financial dataset and saves a
* detailed summary to a text file.
* **Simple Web Interface**: Provides an intuitive web form for users to input financial details
* and receive instant predictions.

### Requirements

The application relies on the following Python libraries:

* **Python 3.x**
* **Flask**: For building the web application.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **scikit-learn**: For machine learning, specifically the `RandomForestClassifier`.
* **pickle**: For serializing and deserializing Python objects (used to save and load the trained model).

You can install these dependencies using `pip` from the `requirements.txt` file (which you would create):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation and Setup
1.	Project Structure:
2.	/your-project-directory
3.	│── financial_risk_assessment.csv   # Your dataset
4.	│── eda_results.txt                 # EDA summary generated by app.py
5.	│── model.pkl                       # Trained machine learning model
6.	│── label_encoders.pkl              # Placeholder for label encoders (empty in this case)
7.	│── /templates                      # HTML templates
8.	│   ├── index.html
9.	│   └── results.html
10.	│── app.py                          # Flask web application
11.	│── model.py                        # Model training script
12.	│── requirements.txt                # Python dependencies (create this file)
13.	│── README.md                       # Project documentation (this file)
14.	Place your dataset: Ensure your dataset, named financial_risk_assessment.csv, is in the root directory of your project (same level as app.py and model.py).
15.	Create requirements.txt: Create a file named requirements.txt in your project root with the following content:
16.	flask
17.	pandas
18.	scikit-learn
19.	Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
20.	Install dependencies:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
21.	Train the Machine Learning Model: Run the model.py script once to train the
 RandomForestClassifier and save it as model.pkl, along with an empty label_encoders.pkl file.
Bash
python model.py
This script will:
o	Load financial_risk_assessment.csv.
o	Select 'Income', 'Loan Amount', and 'Debt-to-Income Ratio' as features.
o	Handle missing values by dropping rows.
o	Create a target variable 'Will Repay' (1 if 'Debt-to-Income Ratio' < 0.4, else 0).
o	Train a RandomForestClassifier.
o	Save the trained model to model.pkl and an empty label_encoders.pkl.
22.	Run the Flask Application:
Bash
python app.py
This will start the Flask development server. Upon startup, it will also automatically perform EDA
and save the results to eda_results.txt.
23.	Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Project Structure (Detailed)
•	financial_risk_assessment.csv: The dataset containing financial information for loan repayment prediction.
•	eda_results.txt: A text file generated by app.py at startup, containing a summary of descriptive statistics,
missing values, and basic insights from the dataset.
•	model.pkl: The serialized (trained) RandomForestClassifier model used for predictions.
•	label_encoders.pkl: A serialized empty dictionary, used as a placeholder for potential label encoders, though
not strictly needed for this specific model as all features are numeric.
•	/templates/: Contains the HTML templates for the web interface:
o	index.html: The main page with the form for user input.
o	results.html: Displays the prediction outcome.
•	app.py: The main Flask application script. It handles:
o	Loading the trained model and label encoders.
o	Serving the input form (/).
o	Processing user input from the form (/predict).
o	Making predictions using the loaded model.
o	Rendering the results page.
o	Performing and saving the EDA summary when the application starts.
•	model.py: A separate script responsible for loading the dataset, preprocessing it,
 training the RandomForestClassifier, and saving the trained model and label encoders.
•	requirements.txt: Lists all Python packages required for the project.
Usage
1.	Review EDA Results: After running app.py, check the eda_results.txt file in your project directory for a
comprehensive overview of your dataset. This includes summary statistics, missing values, and data insights.
2.	Access the Prediction Form: Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.
3.	Enter Financial Details: Input the borrower's 'Income', 'Loan Amount', and 'Debt-to-Income Ratio' into the respective fields.
4.	Get Prediction: Click the "Predict Loan Repayment" button.
5.	View Outcome: The application will display whether the borrower is
"✅ Yes, likely to repay the loan." or "❌ No, unlikely to repay the loan." based on the model's prediction.
